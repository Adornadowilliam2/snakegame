# How to fix the error in vscode the npm in Windows

- just follow this code and goodluck hope it works

The error "npm cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system" is typically caused by PowerShell's Execution Policy settings, which prevent scripts from being executed by default. This can block npm (Node Package Manager) and other scripts from running in the VSCode terminal.

- To fix this, you'll need to adjust the Execution Policy for PowerShell on your system. Here's how you can do it:

- Step-by-Step Fix: Adjust PowerShell Execution Policy
Open PowerShell as Administrator:

- Press Win + X and select Windows PowerShell (Admin), or search for PowerShell in the Start menu, right-click on it, and select Run as Administrator.
Check the Current Execution Policy: Type the following command in the PowerShell window to see the current execution policy:

- Get-ExecutionPolicy
You might see something like Restricted or AllSigned, which is why scripts like npm are being blocked.

- Change the Execution Policy: You can change the execution policy to allow local scripts to run by using one of the following options:

### Unrestricted: 
This allows all scripts to run, including unsigned scripts. (Not the most secure, but works for most cases.)

### RemoteSigned: 
This allows locally created scripts to run, but requires downloaded scripts to be signed by a trusted publisher. (This is a safer option and usually recommended.)

To set the policy to RemoteSigned (recommended), run the following command:


```php
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
- RemoteSigned allows you to run locally created scripts without signing them, but scripts downloaded from the internet must be signed by a trusted publisher.

You can also use Unrestricted if you prefer:

```php
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser
```

After running either of the above commands, you will be prompted to confirm the change. Type Y and hit Enter to confirm.

- Restart VSCode: After changing the execution policy, restart your Visual Studio Code and open a new terminal.

- Verify the Fix: Try running npm again in the VSCode terminal, and it should now work without the "scripts are disabled" error.

## Additional Notes

Scope: The -Scope CurrentUser flag ensures that the change only applies to your user account, not system-wide. This is usually the safest option and won't affect other users on the system.


Security: Setting the execution policy to RemoteSigned or Unrestricted can have security implications. While RemoteSigned is typically fine for most developers, be cautious with Unrestricted, especially if you're running scripts from untrusted sources.

- If You Need to Revert Changes:
If you ever need to revert to the default (more restrictive) policy, you can run:

```php
Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser
```
